# CreateLocalCOOLdb

#### What is this?

Basic python based script to generate a (local) COOL database
from a neural net stored in a JSON file using the same
conventions as required by Dan's lightweight neural network client
which is then to be used in a local test run using the
flavour tagging performance framework.


#### How do I use it?

Run `./CreateLocalCOOLdb <base root file> <json file to add>`.

For more info, run the converter with no arguments (**do NOT source
this script**)

`./CreateLocalCOOLdb`

This will print help. Please follow the instructions.
